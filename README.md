# mail-handler
Well... I'm trying to learn Ktor.

This application should be able to:
- Send emails with a specific html previously stored in database
- User should be able to store an html file and associate it to a entity (user/company)
- This HTML file will have variables on it so use a render template such as velocity
- Along with HTML file, user can store all variables in document in order to fetch it later
- Enjoy
- annnnnnnnnnd teach you ktor
